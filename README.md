### Description

As a Full Stack Web Developer, I want to have an application created with the latest technologies to feature a collection of the best projects I have developed so far, So that I can also showcase my professional value in a competitive way to employers .

This portfolio features relevant technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL / NoSQL Databases, MERN: Mongo, Express, Node, React, and polished UI interfaces.

Every featured project presents a brief description, and functional icons to see the live application and to see the Github repository. The footer includes links to my main internet handles on Github, LinkedIn, my Resume and a link to contact me by email.
